What I asked:
Can you please debug my code?

What response I received (summarized):
Edited the code on lines 11-21 of UserStory.java to help the code work as intended.
Helped me to create this part of the code(inspiration also taken from code.org):

public Hitter[] createHitters(String bNamesFile, String avgFile) {
    String[] bNames = FileReader.toStringArray(bNamesFile);
    double[] avg = FileReader.toDoubleArray(avgFile);

    Hitter[] allHitters = new Hitter[bNames.length];

    for (int i = 0; i < bNames.length; i++) {
      allHitters[i] = new Hitter(bNames[i], avg[i]);
    }
    return allHitters;
  }
